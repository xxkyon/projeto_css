        I'm the man in the box
        Buried in my shit
        Won't you come and save me?
        Save me
        Feed my eyes
        (Can you sew them shut?)
        Jesus Christ
        (Deny your maker)
        He who tries
        (Will be wasted)
        Oh, feed my eyes
        (Now you've sewn them) shut
        I'm the dog who gets beat
        Shove my nose in shit
        Won't you come and save me?
        Save me
        Feed my eyes
        (Can you sew them shut?)
        Jesus Christ
        (Deny your maker)
        He who tries
        (Will be wasted)
        Oh, feed my eyes
        (Now you've sewn them) shut
        Feed my eyes
        (Can you sew them shut?)
        Jesus Christ
        (Deny your maker)
        He who tries
        (Will be wasted)
        Oh, feed my eyes
        (Now you've sewn them) 
        <b>shut</b></h2>
